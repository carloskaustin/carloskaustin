## About Me

I'm currently sharpening my data skills as a master's candidate at Baruch College, focusing on business analytics with a concentration in data analytics. My journey began as a researcher at MDRC, where I studied the impact of policies and programs on people with low incomes—a role that ignited my passion for using data to drive positive change.

Outside of academics, you'll find me exploring the world, staying active through sports and fitness, and enjoying music whenever I can.

## 💬 Favorite Quote

> "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God."
